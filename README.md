# Park Service Volunteer Program

## About

Park Service Volunteer Program helps maintain two different parks by helping to keep a record of the volunteers, their maintenance activities, and hours worked. The project focuses on using type guards to combine, verify, sum, and sort the parksâ€™ volunteers and their hours of contribution.

## Features and code breakdown

- _raccoon-meadows-log.ts_ and _wolf-point-log.ts_ contain data and types for the volunteers of each park. This data is exported and imported for use in _index.ts_.
- The `combineVolunteers()` function takes an array of the volunteers of different types from both parks as an argument and uses the `map()` and `forEach()` methods to combine them into a single list that matches the `Volunteers` type. The function uses a type guard together with the `parseInt()` function to check and convert a volunteer's id from a `string` to a `number` where necessary.
- Helper functions, `isVerified()`, `getHours()`, are created for use in `calculateHours()`.
- `isVerified()` uses a type guard with the `typeof` operator to check whether the hours for each volunteer has been verified before adding it to the total.
- `getHours()` uses a type guard with the `in` operator to ensure the correct property is accessed for each volunteer's hours since they are recorded under different property names for each of the parks.
- The `calculateHours()` function takes in an array of the combined volunteers as its argument. It uses the `map()` and `forEach()` methods together with the `isVerified()` and `getHours()` helper functions to check and retrieve the number of hours for each volunteer. The function returns a new array of volunteers along with their verified number of hours.
- The `compareByHours()` is a custom comparator function. It is passed to the array `sort()` method and allows for the results to be sorted by the number of hours in descending order.
